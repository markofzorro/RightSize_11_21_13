   Proportions</H1>
  <P>
   &quot;The proportion of women in this room is 80%.&quot;</P>
  <P>
   A proportion measures the central tendency of a <A HREF="..\Concepts\Variables.htm#Definition_of_discrete_variable">discrete
    variable</A>, just as a mean measures a continuous variable. </P>
  <P>
   When the target population is small, you can determine the proportion 
   directly. For example, if there are 20 people in the room, you can 
   count all the people and their determine that 16 (80%) are women. But 
   if there ate 1000 people in the room. the target population is 1000 
   and it would be tedious and perhaps innacurate to try to count them 
   all. You might look at the proportion sample to estimate the 
   proportion in the target population.</P>
  <P>
   In the target population, the proportion is P, the number of 
   individuals is N, and the number of individuals with the 
   characteristic you are counting is A. The formula is:</P>

  <P>
   If the target population has 40 people and 10 of them have colds, 
   then <IMG SRC="Population proportion example.jpg" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="46" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   have colds.</P>
  <P>
   Similarly, if you take a sample to estimate the proportion in the 
   target population, the sample size is n, the proportion is p, and the 
   number with the characteristic you are measuring is a. Note that the 
   sample equation uses all small letters, while the capital letters 
   refer to the population.</P>

   <IMG SRC="sample proportion formula.jpg" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="46" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   if we take a sample of 3 from the above population and find that one 
   of them has a cold and two do not, the results are:</P>
  <P>
   <IMG SRC="Sample proportion example.jpg" WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="46" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0">,
    which is an estimate of the proportion of the people in the target 
   population who have colds.</P>
  <P>
   Proportions are written as decimals based on 1, or sometimes as 
   percentages are based on 100. It is easy to convert, but it is also 
   easy to mix them up in equations unless you pay careful attention.</P>
