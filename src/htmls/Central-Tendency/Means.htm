   Means</H1>
  <P>
   A mean or average is a way to measure the central tendency of <A HREF="..\Concepts\Variables.htm#Definition_of_continuous_variable">continuous
    variables</A>. You sum up the values for each individual and divide 
   by the number of individuals.</P>
  <P>
   The formula for a population mean is a bit intimidating until you 
   look at each part separately. It is worth understanding the notation, 
   because it comes up later for other important statistical concepts. 
   The population mean formula is:</P>
  <P>
   <IMG SRC="Population mean formula.jpg" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="136" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   Where &#181; is the population mean. <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">N</SPAN> 
   is the total number of individuals in the population and each 
   individual is represnted by an an <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">i</SPAN>.
    The x stands for the characteristic you are measuring in each of the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">i</SPAN> 
   individuals. For example, if you are measuring people's body 
   temperature, the first person to be measured is represented by <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">i</SPAN> 
   = 1. If his temperature of 37 degrees Centegrate then x<SUB>1</SUB> = 
   37 degrees, the second person is <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">i</SPAN> 
   = 2 and his temperature is x<SUB>2</SUB>, and so on.</P>
  <P>
   The <IMG SRC="episilon.jpg" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="28" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   means &quot;add up the x value for each of the i individuals.&quot; 
   The number below the <IMG SRC="episilon.jpg" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="28" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   means start with this individual. In this equation, the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">i</SPAN> 
   = 1 means start with the first individual. The number above the above 
   the <IMG SRC="episilon.jpg" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="28" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   means &quot;stop when you reach this number,&quot; which, in the 
   above equation, is the total number of individuals in the population.</P>
  <P>
   So <IMG SRC="episilon N i xi.jpg" WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="45" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   means count up all the x variables for each of the <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">i</SPAN> 
   members of the population, starting with the first and stopping when 
   you have reached the total number of individuals.</P>
  <P>
   For example, if your whole population consists of 5 children and we 
   are interested in the mean of their ages, which are 1,2,3,4, and 5. 
   The calculations would be:</P>

  <P>
   If you decide to take a sample to make an estimate of the mean in the 
   target population, use the formula for the sample mean, which is similar:</P>
  <P>
   <IMG SRC="sample mean formula.gif" WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="64" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   Note that <IMG SRC="mu.gif" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   is the population mean, while <IMG SRC="x bar.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="21" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0"> 
   is the sample mean. Similarly, N is the number of individuals in the 
   target population, while n is the number of individuals in the sample.</P>
  <P>
   If we chose our sample as the first three children of the target 
   population, the calculations for the mean of their ages would be:</P>
  <P>
   <IMG SRC="Sample mean example.jpg" WIDTH="116" HEIGHT="46" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0">,
    which gives us an estimate of the mean for the whole target population.</P>
