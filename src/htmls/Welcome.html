   RightSize is a teaching aid for programs that teach field and applied 
   epidemiology. We hope that it will be useful for trainees as they are 
   learning statistics or as a refresher after they graduate. Of course, 
   we also hope it will be useful in designing more efficient and useful surveys.</P>
  <P>
   After using the program, we hope that you will</P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    be able to calculate useful sample sizes for surveys,</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    have a solid understanding of the concepts you are using, and</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    feel good about applying the concepts.</P>
   </OL>
  <P>
   The program is a result of collaborations among the programs in 
   Training in Epidemiology and Applied Public Health Interventions 
   Network (TEPHINET). The trainees and staffs of many programs 
   contributed helpful suggestions and did testing. We especially want 
   to thank the Philippine and Japanese Field Epidemiology Training 
   Programs, and the Uganda, Zimbabwe, and Vietnam Public Health Schools 
   Without Walls.</P>
  <P>
